## General Guidelines
- Generate typescripe code with ES6+ syntax.
- Format Responses with clear comments explaining each step.

## File Size Constraints
- Keep all source code files under 200 lines to optimize
- Use modularization (e.g., split large functions into smaller files) if a file exceeds 200 lines.
- Prioritize generating code that adheres to this limit, suggesting refactoring if necessary.

## Quality Requirements
- All code must pass linting rules
- All typescript code must pass ESLint rule enforcing max-lines-per-file of 200.
- All golang code must use golangci-lint filen to enforce max of 200 lines.

## Typescript Requirements

## Golang Requirements
- Use golangci-lint to enforce code standards
- All golang tests should be written in a table driven design


## Utilities
- Use Makefiles for entry points into the project
