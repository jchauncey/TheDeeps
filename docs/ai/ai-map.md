# AI Map
## Map Generation Requirements

1. **Map Structure**
   - Maps must have a minimum of 5 rooms and a maximum of 20 rooms per floor
   - Each floor should have at least one staircase to the next floor
   - The final floor must contain a boss room
   - Maps should have a logical layout with no disconnected areas
   - Hallways should connect rooms in a sensible manner

2. **Room Types**
   - Standard rooms (empty or with basic enemies)
   - Treasure rooms (containing loot)
   - Boss rooms (containing a powerful enemy)
   - Puzzle rooms (requiring player to solve a puzzle)
   - Safe rooms (no enemies, may contain healing resources)
   - Shop rooms (where players can trade resources)

3. **Room Properties**
   - Each room must have a unique identifier
   - Rooms should have variable sizes (small, medium, large)
   - Rooms can contain environmental hazards (traps, lava, etc.)
   - Rooms may contain interactive objects (chests, levers, etc.)
   - Rooms should have appropriate enemy spawns based on difficulty level

4. **Doors and Connections**
   - Doors can be standard, locked, or hidden
   - Locked doors require specific keys or conditions to open
   - Hidden doors require player discovery (through skills or items)
   - Some doors may be one-way only
   - Doors should visually match their environment

5. **Difficulty Scaling**
   - Lower floors should be easier than deeper floors
   - Enemy density and strength should increase with depth
   - Loot quality should improve with depth
   - Environmental hazards should become more dangerous with depth
   - Puzzles should become more complex with depth

6. **Procedural Generation Parameters**
   - Maps should be generated with a seed value for reproducibility
   - Generation should account for desired difficulty level
   - Maps should have themes that affect visual appearance and enemy types
   - Generation should ensure all areas are accessible
   - Special rooms (boss, treasure) should be appropriately placed

7. **Navigation and Exploration**
   - Unexplored areas should be hidden until discovered
   - Map should track discovered rooms, doors, and stairs

8. **Technical Requirements**
   - Map data structure should be serializable for saving/loading
   - Generation should be efficient and complete in under 5 seconds
   - Map should support dynamic modifications during gameplay
   - Collision detection system for walls and obstacles
   - Pathfinding system for AI navigation
