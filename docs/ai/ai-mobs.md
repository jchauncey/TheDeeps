# AI Mobs

These are the requirements for mobs or monsters within the game system

- Mobs can have variants ranging from easy to hard
- The loot scales with the variant
- Easier mobs drop less gold and lower quality items 
- Harder mobs drop more gold and higher quality items
- The main types of mobs for now will be - skeletons, goblins, trolls, orcs, ogres, wraiths, liches, oozes, ratmen, drakes, dragons, and elementals
- When the server generates a floor it spawns the mobs for that floorrr
- Spawning the mobs will generate a version of that mob based on the current floorr
- This data will be returned to the client
- The definition of the mobs should be in a file that is easy to keep up to date or modify
